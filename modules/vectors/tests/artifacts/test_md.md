# Light
Light is a electromagnetic wave in space. Most waveforms require a medium to actually excitate or distrub in order to exist like sound. However, lights medium is space - the vaccum. The speed of light is the substrate for all things in the universe and nothing with mass can go the speed of light, which inferes that light itself has no mass. 

## Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetism is a result of polarized or charge matter in space. On a smaller scale the energy from the fields created by the charges create disturbances of force (or something) in space. These waves are simultaneous and oscillating. They are measurable and are thought to be what we call particles. On a very small scale electrons or quarks one of the two are not phyical objects but waveforms that create matter from the vaccum. Everything even light and matter are a result of these waves. 

Certain waveforms and frequencies in our space fabric are visible but massless. Electromagnetic waves are these visible (sometimes not) and measurable disturbances in space. When you see light, we say they are photons, but in reality on a very very small scale they are literally ripples in the space between your eye and the waves origin. 

Words used to describe light:
- Massless
- Visible
- Feelable (infrared/heat)
- Photon
- Frequencies and waves
- +more

## Electromagnetism in a Vaccum
To visualize what this look like if your were an atom or molecule and could see the waves, lets think about an ocean. If the ocean were completely still and reflective even, you not even notice that its water and you would be able to stand on the thing in front of you. However, if you were to drop a rock in it, it would create ripples of energy released in the form of shape change on the surface of the water. This is visible, and would identify anything else that may be mysteriously camoflouged unless water could pass through it. 

Think of light as the same thing, except the water is the vaccum of space itself. When you say, "I see that thing", you dont, you see the light reflecting off of it. Which your brain uses to interpret the matter in front of you. In fact, all of reality is this way.
