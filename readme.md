# Short Summary:

Reflection is an AI project to create a personalized (soon to be local) prediction and AI program to chat with the user about personal research initiatives, plans, and designs. From writing to designing new software. From learning new disciplines to declaring new ones. It will link with popular notation applications such as Obsidian. It will parse, chunk, and embed .md files into a local running ChromaDB database. Then the program will provide a chat or voice interface for interaction. This will be supported by typical interface libraries such as JavaScript Next.js for a web based approach or others similar for desktop based approach. AI predictions were initially planned to be local using a quantized model for optimized predictions. However, to ease the early development process OpenAI and cloud endpoints will be supplemented. AI orchestration will be supported by Langchain/Langgraph. Reflection will be leveraging the Pregel like DAG composition process creating simple & intuitive actions and flows.
